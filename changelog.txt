 v1.7
* Fixed bug where HTML would not show in portal.
* Fixed bug where HTML would not show in thread review within the new reply page.

 v1.6
* Added MyBB 1.8 compatibility.
* Fixed bug in UID override.

 v1.5
* Fixes a problem with previews (again), this time the only fix is not parsing HTML at all in case the user does not have Admin CP access - that's due to MyBB's code. (I may write a better workaround in a later release)

 v1.4
* Fixed a problem with HTML in signatures being parsed.
* Fixed a problem with HTML not being parsed in post previews.

 v1.3
* Re-wrote again.

 v1.2
* Re-wrote the entire thing but uses MyBB's parser now so it should be bug free from now on (unless I messed up permissions somewhere but I don't think so).

 v1.1
* Fixed comments bug. HTML comments would show up as text instead of being hidden in the source of the page.
